# COCO-Data-Extract
Extract images and annotations for specific classes from any COCO Dataset using only the annotation files for that dataset. 
The code in this repo uses the 2017 Validation Dataset. 

This repo contains code for extracting the images and annotations separately, as well as extracting images with annotations drawn on them.
